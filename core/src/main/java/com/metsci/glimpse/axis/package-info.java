/**
 * Provides classes for managing the display area of {@link com.metsci.glimpse.painter.base.GlimpsePainter}
 * instances. {@link com.metsci.glimpse.axis.Axis1D} simply tracks a one-dimensional interval with minimum and maximum values.
 * Multiple {@link com.metsci.glimpse.axis.Axis1D} instances can be linked to create complex interactions between multiple
 * related plots. Axes can be manipulated either programmatically or in response to mouse clicks and drags.
 * Finally, painters are provided for visualizing the axis with tick marks, bounds, and labels.
