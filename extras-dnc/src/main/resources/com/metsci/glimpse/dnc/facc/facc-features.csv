This S-57 value specifically represents a single, individual refuse pile which may be easily and quickly recognized when used as a reference for navigation.   
AB000 US-Disposal Site/Waste Pile UK-Refuse Tip/Slag Heap won't work as it is defined as an area and not a point.  
AM040 US-Mineral Pile UK-Mineral Pile/Mineral Tip won't work as its definition specifically excludes waste material.
UK:  DISCUSS NO  Problem appreciated, but consider removing the “area” restriction from AB000 instead.  UK would use AB000 anyway, and let the product indicate whether it is area or point.  A point is still an area at a larger scale.  Given the “land restriction proposed for AM041, there is am implied mixed concept in AB000 for which the UK names would only apply to land use, but maybe the US name could apply to water use.  The definition makes no restriction.  
CZ: 
     a) The definition generally should not limit the geometric type except where the feature really can not be anything else at any resolution or scale. e.g. trigonometric point cannot be nothing but point.
     b) It is impossible to say what is waste and what is raw material. What is waste for you today can be a raw material for me tomorrow. The material should be simply an attribute not part of feature definition.
US:  YES  This is a new addition to S-57 for Edition 3.1.  This solution was suggested because we need a feature to represent a new type of conspicuous landmark used as a reference for marine navigation, a single refuse pile.  The US and CA when working this issue in May, labored under the understanding that the FACC WP would not entertain any changes to definitions which would fundamentally alter the object such as removing the word ""area"".  I (Buckley) would really prefer to reword AB000, perhaps replacing ""Area"" with ""Site"" or something similar, but I don't see how we can handle both the mandate that the refuse be in only one pile (not many piles) and that it exclude a refuse pile in the water.  This feature needs to be compatible with the S-57 definition for  ENC to DNC conversions.  
If this feature is not approved the US will turn it into a US national code and  those nations  working with both DNCs and ENCs will then need to share a US national code with no input into the configuration control.  This is a situation I would at all costs prefer to avoid.  If only one nation will ever use it, then it probably should be a national code, however in this case several nations will ultimately be using and sharing it.  For that reason alone, it belongs in FACC.
GE:  NO The justification is not sound. First, it is a question of scale, and second AB000 is not defined as an „area feature“. That would not be possible due to the rule „...should not specify if the feature is an area, point or line feature“.
IT:   NO  According with the rules FACC should not specify if the feature is an area, point or line feature.  On IT understanding the AB000 definition does not give any feature type restriction (point, area or line feature).
US:  Withdrawn since mods made to AB000 eliminate need for this feature..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groins are normally constructed perpendicular to a beach, not a harbor or anchorage. They are intended to preserve the beach by preventing the longshore movement of sediments by disrupting the longshore transport mechanisms.  
A breakwater normally is constructed parallel to or at a low angle to the coastline and is intended to protect a harbor or anchorage from waves, wind, and high seas.  Effects on sediment transport are only an incidental side effect which may or may not be deliberate.  Buckley US

US:  NO, unless amended.  I have a question about the name ""Spout"".  I suspect that the name in English should be something else, especially when reading the IT comment.  Are we talking about the water processing and distribution infrastructure which will process the water delivered by the aqueduct.  When I read the word ""Spout"" I immediately think of a spigot or small pipe. Going by the IT comment, I would suggest the US-English term ""Water Works"" with a new definition of ""The processing and distribution infrastructure associated with an aqueduct, excluding the pipes and pipelines used for distribution to the ultimate consumer"".

         2) Depends on the scale as well. And : Conflict with DB160 Rock Strata /Rock Formation.
BE:  An isolated rock and an isolated rocky formation are not necessarily the same thing.
UK:  This conflict will be common when we are mapping to a catalog having a 'higher authority' such as IHO.
ALL: Keep as generic as possible to allow maximum scope for use.
US:  In using the IHO definition, we are being less restrictive however I have changed the feature name to reflect the full scope of the attribute.
UK:  Still thinking!!  FWP6 had a problem with this. Concerned about mixed concepts, confusion with DB160, and meaning of “isolated”   ??????????
CZ:  ""Isolated"" seems to be clear, I understand it as an opposite to connected here. I don't see any scale dependency in it.  FACC deals with real world features, not with maps.
US:  YES
The fundamental purpose of this new feature is to support a mariner looking for conspicuous landmarks to use in fixing his position.  A rock or boulder in a talus slope amongst many others is not conspicuous, one standing alone on a hillside is.  The same goes for a rock outcrop.  In many parts of the world, especially with a paucity of conspicuous landmarks, rocks and outcrops are frequently charted to be used by the mariner as landmarks.  The scale of reference is the mariner's view.  If it can be portrayed as a single object and if the mariner can quickly recognize it with no doubt of it being confused with others, then it belongs here.
IT:  NO  Seems to be in conflict with DB160.  However, needs further discussion!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore a generic ""Meta Object"", to use the S-57 terminology, is needed to support these attributes.","UK: Still thinking about metadata objects in general!  ??????????
CZ: Should ""metadata features"" be mixed with real world features in FACC? Let's have in mind the goals of FACC (DIGEST Part 1)  Metadata should be metadata (or exceptionally attributes) but not features.  
What about consulting with the Metadata WG and ISO/TC 211 Geographic information - Part 15: Metadata?
US: The idea behind adding metadata features was to provide an area delineation within the datasets of where a particular metadata attribute applies and is constant.  Currently we can only apply metadata characteristics to an entire coverage/library (normally in the DQ layer).  What if the nature of the metadata changes within the same layer/coverage?  This solution was thought better than adding a suite of metadata attributes to each and every feature within the library.   As for the Metadata working group coming up with something - they passed it back to us to find a solution.
GE: ???  (Still thinking). It should be taken into consideration that this new subcategory includes features that do not fit in with the FACC landscape at all („FACC provides a means for encoding real world entities or objects for the purpose of an orderly exchange of digital geospatial information between organizations“).  We suggest to retain the S-57 terminology and call the new sub-category „meta objects“ rather than „meta data“.
IT:  NO  IT opinion is that Metadata features do not belong to FACC which “..provide means for encoding real world entities or objects..”. It could be a good idea consult with Metadata WG and ISO/TC211 Geographic Information - Part 15 Metadata.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
